# Self-paced-Resistance-Learning

This is the codes for the paper "Self-paced Resistance Learning against Overfitting on Noisy Labels" 
on https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03059.pdf

I utilize Python 3.7.4 with Torch version 1.1.0.

Please directly train the files, e.g., main_ResNet_symmetric_CIFAR10.py.

The folder MAT contains the results of well-trained models by SPRL on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.

If it has any problems, please contact me, xsshi2013@gmail.com
